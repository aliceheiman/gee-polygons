## About Dynamic World

[Dynamic World](https://dynamicworld.app/) is a near-real-time 10m
resolution global land cover dataset produced by Google and the World
Resources Institute.

Key features: - 10m resolution (Sentinel-2 based) - Near-real-time
updates (~every 5 days) - 9 land cover classes - Available from 2015
onwards

Unlike MapBiomas (band-per-year), Dynamic World is an
**ImageCollection** that you filter by date.

## Usage

``` python
from gee_polygons.datasets.dynamicworld import DYNAMIC_WORLD

# Extract land cover stats (aggregated by year)
df = site.extract_categorical(DYNAMIC_WORLD, years=range(2019, 2025))
```

Since Dynamic World is an ImageCollection, the extractor will: 1. Filter
by year 2. Compute the **mode** (most frequent class) across all images
in that year 3. Calculate pixel counts and areas

``` python
print(DYNAMIC_WORLD)
print(f"\nClass 1: {DYNAMIC_WORLD.class_name(1)} ({DYNAMIC_WORLD.class_color(1)})")
print(f"Class 4: {DYNAMIC_WORLD.class_name(4)} ({DYNAMIC_WORLD.class_color(4)})")
```
